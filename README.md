# Linearisation (the tool)

This is a linearisation verification / testing utility inspired by aritcles / tools listed in the
[reference section here](docs/references.md).

It was created to help me experiment and understand linearisation across various data structures
as well as something that I could learn / discuss / collaborate / share / spikes thoughts and problems
with my supervisor and fellow university mates. It is also an initial attempt with my supervisor to find a
suitable problem area that could potentially be used in my research projects.

This is a team and community effort where every one is encouraged to criticised / participates / collaborate
to generate healthy discussion / thoughts regarding this subject area. I am a potential computer science research
student based in [University of Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au). Feel free to drop a line, swing around if you
are nearby. Any other fellow research mates across the globe are more than welcome to participate in any sort of ways.
