# Linearisation (the tool)

This is a linearisation verification / testing utility inspired by aritcles / tools listed in
[reference section here](docs/references.md).

It was created to help me experiment and understand linearisation across various data structures
as well as something that I could learn / discuss / collaborate / share / spikes thoughts and problems
with my fellow university mates. It is also an initial attempt with my supervisor and I to find a
suitable problem area that could potentially be used in research projects.
