# Fraser - PHD Thesis - Practical Lock-Free
# Chapter 2
## Obstruction Free [Herlihy03a]
- Excessive helping in lock-free algorithm might actually do more harm
e.g. increase memory contention
- Obstraction Free is a concept by Herlihy to not help in conflict but 
rather retry the operation through some sort of exponential backoff.
- more formally data structure is obstruction-free if it completes in a 
finite steps that do not involved contending with other operations for 
memory access.


## Disjoin Access Parallelism [Isreali94]
Bridge gap betweeen formal definition and real performance.

A set of operations are disjoint-access parallel if and only if
any pair of operation invocations which access disjoint sets of memory locations
do not directly affect each othersâ€™ execution

## Double-word Compare and Swap (DCAS) [Bershad93]
Involved using a single shared lock which is known to the operating system, so 
contention will significantly affect performance under memory intensive workload.


## Software level 
- Multi-word Compare And Swap (MCAS)
- Software Transaction Memory (STM)



#Chapter 3

Data Structures especially concurrent ones increase performance / scalability but sacrifise 
reusability.
