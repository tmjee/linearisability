# Counting Networks
Counting Network[1] is an idea that extends from Sorting Network[2]

Sorting Network is a sorting algorithm that do not depends on data, unlike Merge Sort or Quick sort 
or what not

Counting Network is a counting algorithm that basically says that "it doesn't matter which input 
data is comming in, at the output they are going to be in a counted order eg. y0, y1, y2, y3, and then
y0 repeating in that fashion"
