# The SprayList: A Scalable Relaxed Priority Queue

- Priority Queue with relaxed ordering semantics.
- Functionally similar to conventional concurrent non-blocking SkipList appart from 
`DeleteMin` operation
- `DeleteMin` done by spraying on SkipList, landing at height H, jumping across L length
and decending D, until reaches the bottom where it tries to pick up the `Node`.
- If failed for whatever reason (e.g. `Node` marked, contention or `Node` is a padding 
`Node`, retry spray.
- Proved that high probabilities `DeleteMin` return an element among the first 
O(p log^3 p) where p is the number of threads.
- Proved that high probabilities, `DeleteMin` will retrun in O(log^3 p) regardless of 
SkipList size.
- unlike traditional SkipList that randomly starts at the left-most `Node` clashing on the 
first element of each level, SparyList allows `Node` to be skip ahead, reducing contention.
